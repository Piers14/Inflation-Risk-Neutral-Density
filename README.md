# Inflation RND

A web application (built using R Shiny) which computes the risk-neutral density function of future inflation rates. 

The app is available at https://shiny.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/shiny/InflationRND/

A smoothing spline is fitted to the implied volatilites of market prices for inflation caps and floors. The fitted spline can be transformed into a probability density function under the risk-neutral measure.
